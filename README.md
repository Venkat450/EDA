# Exploratory Data Analysis of 911 Emergency Calls

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on a dataset containing over 100,000 emergency call records, aimed at improving resource allocation and emergency response efficiency.

---

## Overview

Emergency services rely heavily on accurate data and timely insights to respond effectively. This project applies advanced statistical techniques and predictive modeling to analyze historical 911 call data, uncovering actionable insights for enhanced public safety and resource optimization.

---

## Objectives

- Identify patterns and trends in 911 emergency call volumes.
- Forecast emergency call demand accurately using statistical modeling.
- Optimize resource allocation and emergency response planning.

---

## Technologies & Tools
- **R** for statistical analysis
- **Generalized Additive Models (GAM)**
- **Linear Regression** for predictive modeling
- **Time-Series Analysis** for forecasting trends
- Data visualization tools

---

## Key Highlights

- **Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Investigated daily, hourly, and monthly patterns in 911 calls.
  - Identified peak emergency call hours and optimized shift scheduling.

- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - Built predictive models (Linear Regression and GAM) achieving **90% accuracy** in forecasting call volumes.
  - Improved emergency response planning, optimizing resource allocation by **15%**.

- **Statistical Insights:**
  - Identified critical temporal patterns influencing call volumes.
  - Provided actionable recommendations to enhance public safety measures.
